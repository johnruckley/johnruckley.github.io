**Name**: anonymous_images

**Category**: misc

**Points**: 100 (2 flags)

**Description**:
Evil corp is sending secret messages to each other via images! Fortunately we were able to intercept the images, as well as the key they were using. Use the key "evilCorp" to find the hidden flag!

## **Flag 1**

For flag 1, we got the hint that the flag was in the metadata of the provided png. So I used exiftool, a command line tool for editing metadata, which we learned about last week, and ran the command `exiftool flag1.png` and the flag was right there in the “Evil Corp” field. 


## **Flag 2**

For flag 2, we got the hint that the flag was hidden in the png using least significant bit steganography, and specifically the blue channel was changed. So I got AI to write me code using python’s pillow library for image processing that took the lsb of every blue value of every pixel and converted it bytes and got the flag. 

Alternatively, I looked for a command line tool that would make this easier and came across zsteg, a tool specifically for extracting hidden messages in images. By running the command `zsteg -c b flag2.png`, it searches for messages in the lsb of the blue channel and I was able to get the flag with about 1% of the effort.
